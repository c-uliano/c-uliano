# Hello all, you can call me Colette.

I'm a Web Designer & Developer building websites for a variety of clients, using WordPress as the CMS.

My previous role was as a UX/UI designer & front-end developer for a cyber security firm. I worked up the UX/UI design and mocked-up layouts that were used as the guidelines for myself and the other developers. 

Before that I was a graphic designer & front-end developer for 8 years for a web development & marketing company. Half of the time I designed and built custom websites using the company's custom-built CMS and front-end framework. The rest of the time I designed logos, visual identities, and extensive digital/print marketing materials.

I started my career at Cleveland State University's Campus Recreation Services as a graphic designer, working my up over 2 years to become the senior graphic designer. I've gained lots of experience in the professional setting, but I'm always interested in broadening my experience and skill set with new opportunities.

I continued my development education by learning React, npm, and Node.js. I have a year of basic experience with React, and until I can find another position to learn and expand my skills I build stuff here so I can keep practicing.

<!--
To be able to further my development career I decided to enroll in Coding Dojo's bootcamp. I worked my way through Python (MySQL, Flask, Ajax, APIs) and MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). I'm focused on gaining experience using front-end libraries like React and SolidJS.
