I am the graphic designer and front-end developer for a web development & marketing company in Cleveland, OH. Before that I worked as the senior graphic designer for about a year and a half at Cleveland State University's Campus Recreation Services. I have gained lots of experience in the professional setting, but I'm always interested in broadening my experience and skill set with new opportunities.
