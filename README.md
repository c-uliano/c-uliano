# My name is Colette

I am the graphic designer and frontend developer for a web development & marketing company in Cleveland, OH. Before that I worked as the senior graphic designer for about a year and a half at Cleveland State University's Campus Recreation Services. I have gained lots of experience in the professional setting, but I'm always interested in broadening my experience and skill set with new opportunities.

To be able to furture my development career I decided to enroll in Coding Dojo's bootcamp. Currently working my way through MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.
